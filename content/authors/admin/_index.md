Elizabeth Westerberg recently completed her Ph.D. in Biostatistics at Vanderbilt University. Her research interests include survival analysis, Bayesian methods, and meta-analysis. She worked under the advisement of Dr. Qingxia Chen, with a particular focus on applications to oncology. 

In addition to her work as a Graduate Research Assistant, she has served as a Medical Economics Analyst for Wayspring, a company that contracts with health insurers to reduce opioid dependency among their members, as well as a collaborator with the Vanderbilt Brain Institute.
